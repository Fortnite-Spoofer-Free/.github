# Fortnite Spoofer Free

Fortnite SPOOFER is a tool that hides or changes your computer‚Äôs hardware IDs (HWID) to avoid or bypass a ban in Fortnite. If you get HWID banned, BattlEye saves your hardware information and blocks you even if you create a new account. A spoofer tricks the system by changing your hardware "fingerprint," making it look like you‚Äôre using a completely different PC.
